# Logotype Animation for We Construction

A pure javascript web animation mainly for We Construction website, but also for a wide variety of other uses.

## Purpose
Communicate key values as the logo reveals

* Professional
* Modern
* Family values

#### Professional
* We take on grand projects
* We can compete with the big established ones
* We deliver on time, budget and quality standards

#### Modern
* We use a differentiating IT system
* We handle project information smarter
* We allow data to input once and used in multiple contexts

#### Family values
* We have a healthy view on our employees
* We care about relationships
* We value a human aspect

## Result

The main challenge here was to abstract the key value messages and convert them into something familiar and emotional that could be digested, understood and memorized in just a few seconds.
